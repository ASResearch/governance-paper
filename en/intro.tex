Nebulas is an open-source public chain. Nebulas is \textbf{Autonomous Metanet}~\cite{AutonomousMetanet}. Focus on on-chain data, interactions, and collaboration. Let everyone get values from decentralized collaboration fairly through technical ways such as blockchain.~\cite{vision}。

This Orange Paper will introduce in order to achieve Nebulas vision, Nebulas how to use the special innovative technology to \textbf{governance on-chain public assets, discover a new decentralized collaboration, and build a new Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)~\cite{DAO} which privides positive incentives and self-evolving}. Nebulas governance has been designed in the follow three aspects, and this paper will introduce one by one:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Organization and supervision}:
	Nebulas Community Group, which operate independently and restrict each other: Nebulas Council, Nebulas Foundation, Nebulas Technical Committee, describing their members composition, powers, and obligaations.
	\item \textbf{On-chain collaboration}:
	The process of community collaboration and system upgrade via \textbf{NAT On-chain Voting}” (Reference: \ref{nat}).
	\item \textbf{Economy and incentive}: 
	The economy of NAT On-chain Voting. And through the process of Nebulas governance, how this economy provides positive incentives to each member in the community.
\end{enumerate}
