Nebulas is an open-source, public blockchain focused on creating a true \textbf{Autonomous Metanet}~\cite{AutonomousMetanet}. Nebulas' focus is on-chain data, users interactions and collaboration. Our core principal is ''Let everyone get values from decentralized collaboration fairly through technical ways such as blockchain.''~\cite{vision}。

This Orange Paper will introduce how Nebulas will use it's innovative technology to realize its vision \textbf{collaboration model with the help of unique innovative technologies to manage public assets in the chain, and realize the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)~\cite{DAO} that will provide positive incentives and self-evolution}. Nebulas governance has been designed with the following three aspects which will be explained one by one:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Organization and supervision}:
	Nebulas Community Groups which operate independently and constrain one-another: Nebulas Council, Nebulas Foundation, Nebulas Technical Committee; detailing their member composition, power, and obligations.
	\item \textbf{On-chain collaboration}:
	The process of community collaboration and system upgrade via \textbf{NAT On-chain Voting}” (Reference: \ref{nat}).
	\item \textbf{Economy and incentive}: 
	The economy of NAT On-chain Voting, the process of Nebulas governance and how this economy model provides positive incentives to each member within the community.
\end{enumerate}
